1. Create database:
Table: User
Table: Journal

2.Install the following Node Modules:
express
ejs layouts
express-session
body-parser
pg pg-hstore
sequelize

app.set("view engine, ejs"); //tells express to look for ejs files and use

3. Great notes on passport:
https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport
//passport is a library that makes authorization easier

//session is keeping track from page to page load by holding it in a cookie
//flash needs it because it is using the session for the next page


//STUFF I NEED TO FIX!!!
1. Create seperate journals for each person that logs in. Keeps taking user to same 1 log in screen.
2. Create Group capability
3. Set up so when user creates new entries it posts correcty in journal db. Currently not linking userId or username.
4. When user hits edit button redirect back to userjournal page.
5. Fix back button as well!
