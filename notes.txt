1. Create database:
Table: User
Table: Journal

2.Install the following Node Modules:
express
ejs layouts
express-session
body-parser
pg pg-hstore
sequelize

app.set("view engine, ejs"); //tells express to look for ejs files and use

3. Great notes on passport:
https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport
//passport is a library that makes authorization easier

//session is keeping track from page to page load by holding it in a cookie
//flash needs it because it is using the session for the next page
